This project is a simple bulk mailer application made with purpose of 
send Christmas messages to customers. You can connect to either an local 
or remote SMTP server, that requires authentication or not. It asks as 
input an prebuilt HTML email file and an csv file containing a list of 
emails (and other data) to send emails to. The application intends to 
send individual messages peer recipient with proper treatment inside 
each message ('Dear mr. Fulano', as treatment for an male recipient 
named Fulano). You just need to specify, inside the HTML message, a tag 
that determines where the recipient name will be put: 'Hello, 
{RECIPIENTSNAME}!' and set it in the proper configuration step. This app 
also can be used as an massive mail attack or spam tool, so be careful 
and use it with responsability.

Main class: TelaPrincipal.java.

Good luck!
